		<h1>
			inhaler
		</h1>
		<p> I was prescribed this inhaler in 2021. I have allergies, but have
		never had asthma as far as I know. I was really sick, having lost my voice
	and struggling to breathe. I don't recall too much of it, but I remember trying not
to pass out on the bus or on the street waiting for the bus (which seemed to take a fucking
eternity to arrive) on my way home from gathering my prescriptions. The other medicine
I had received was lidocaine viscous, and happened to be the most disgusting and foul
thing I had ever encountered. <br> Anyways, I have held on to the inhaler ever since, just in case.
It has really come in handy the last year or so, ever since I met my boyfriend who
happens to have asthma. I'm glad that I kept it, that I know it will be here
if he ever happens to forget his and there's an emergency. It has become an item of comfort.	 </p>
