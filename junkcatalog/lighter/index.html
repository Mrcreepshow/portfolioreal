		<h1>
			fish lighter
		</h1>
		<p>
			Back in middle school, maybe early highschool, I was hunting around this old antique desk that my
			mother had inherited from her grandmother. It contained a lot of her own personal junk, family junk,
			all the works. I used to poke through it as a kid, look at the fun pens and pencils, the greeting card stockpile
			that she kept on hand. I had come across this glorious and colorful fish lighter, though I was way too young
			to have any use for it so it never really left the drawer. Anyways, middle/highschool me, I was searching
			in hopes to rediscover the fish lighter. I knew it existed, that it hadn't left its spot, and that I wanted it.
			It didn't take much to relocate it, and once I did I shoved it into my pocket and scurried out of the office.
			Playing around with it for a while, I was very excited to bring it to my next group outing with friends. Of course,
			I knew it would be a hit, that I would reign in comments over how adorable it was. It certainly made its way through
			my lighter rotation, though it was the one I kept the closest eye on. I've lost many a lighter in my lifetime, through
			thieves or misplacement, and I knew damn well I would not lose this one. To this day it remains my go-to, it has seen
			a number of mini bics inside of its casing, and to this day I still do not know if my mom ever noticed its disappearance.
