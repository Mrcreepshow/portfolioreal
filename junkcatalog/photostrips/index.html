			photostrips

		<p>
			The top photostrip, from Starland Yards, contains my sister, brother and I.
			It was taken in Savannah, where my sister lives, in June of 2023. We had planned
			a trip to visit her new home for the first time since moving about two years prior;
		  I am already elated to plan a trip again soon, to be able to spend more time with
			her and hopefully including my other siblings as well. I cherish any time that I
			get to spend with them as I was born much later, and spent much of my adolescence
			without their consistent prescences in our home.
