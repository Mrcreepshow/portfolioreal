				My boyfriend bought this worrystone for me before we started dating while on a short weekend trip with
				his family. He had come back to town and let me pick from a little bag with three different ones, one for
				me, one for his cousin and one for him. I was so excited, I didn't have any expectations for a gift from him
				at this point, and it is the kind of small gesture that melts my heart just a little bit. I kept it next to my
				bed for a while, grabbing it when I needed. As I was moving, I had a specific spot that I packed it, but it happened
				to be a little too specific and I had completely forgotten where it went. I searched my belongings high and low
				with no luck. I felt so horrible, losing something that meant a lot to me and had to accept defeat. Thankfully, as I was
				sifting through other small trinket stashes looking for something else a few months later, it finally turned up.
				I was so, so relieved to see it again and tucked it away in my drawer so I can always know where it lives.
